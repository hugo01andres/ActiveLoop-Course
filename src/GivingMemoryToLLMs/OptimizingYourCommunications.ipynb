For example, if you are working with large datasets or complex algorithms, having extra memory can help improve processing speed and prevent crashes. Additionally, if you are running multiple programs or tasks simultaneously, extra memory can help prevent your computer from slowing down.

      "AI:  That's a great question! Langchain has three main types of memory: short-term, long-term, and working memory. Short-term memory is used for temporary storage of information, such as remembering a phone number or a list of items. Long-term memory is used for storing information for a longer period of time, such as memories from childhood or important facts. Working memory is used for actively processing and manipulating information, such as solving a math problem or following instructions. The type of memory to use depends on the task at hand. For short-term tasks, short-term memory is sufficient. For long-term tasks, long-term memory is necessary. And for tasks that require active processing, working memory is the most suitable.\n",
